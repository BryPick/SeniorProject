# SeniorProject
Senior project that entailed working with a sponsor from a local company to produce a scheduling application

## Extra
A lot of the files were done by myself. I marked all the .php files that were done by me with a comment at the top:

```php
/**
	Done by Bryan Pickering
*/
```

Files not done by me are:
-Anything under /Business/Bus
-busdriverroster.php
-finalBusSchdule.php
-generateSchdule.php
-inputBusBlackouts.php
